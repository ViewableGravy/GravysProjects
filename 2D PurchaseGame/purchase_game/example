if (key == 'w') then
move left one up

if (key == 'up') then
move right one up


every time you click, that key is stored in the variable "key"
if i click i, key = i; if i click k key = k

key can only store one value at a time, so if two buttons are pressed, key is only one of them


solution: 

sandwich = 
["dororo opening", "another opening", "sdsd"]

sandwich[0] : "dororo opening"
